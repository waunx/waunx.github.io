**Xu Wan (‰∏áÊó≠)** is a second-year PhD student at the College of Control Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University, and currently serves as a visiting student at the [IDEAL Lab](https://www.ideallab-smy.com/) of Peking University under the supervision of [Prof. Mingyang Sun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Vq9aHxoAAAAJ&hl). During my graduate studies, I have gained valuable research experience as a research intern at NetEase Fuxi AI Lab, Ele.me, and Alibaba DAMO Academy, collaborating with [Dr. Yujing Hu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IR5WY-wAAAAJ&hl), [Prof. Wotao Yin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kpQGGFUAAAAJ&hl), and [Cheng Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=5QdPzoAAAAAJ). I am currently a research intern with ByteDance's Seed-Robotic team.

My research interests encompass reinforcement learning, large language models, and large-scale AI applications, with a particular focus on power grid scheduling. I have published several first-author papers at top international AI conferences including ICML, AAAI, and IJCAI, as well as in top journals such as IEEE Transactions on Power Systems with google citations <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NhsHZZwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>

Beyond research, I am passionate about fitness and enjoys running and strength training. You can follow my training journey on my [Strava profile](https://www.strava.com/athletes/wan_kris). I am also enthusiastic about trail running and hiking.
