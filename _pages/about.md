**Xu Wan (‰∏áÊó≠)** is a second-year PhD student at the College of Control Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University, and currently serves as a visiting student at the [IDEAL Lab](https://www.ideallab-smy.com/) of Peking University under the supervision of [Prof. Mingyang Sun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Vq9aHxoAAAAJ&hl). During his graduate studies, he has gained valuable research experience as a research intern at NetEase Fuxi AI Lab, Ele.me, and Alibaba DAMO Academy, collaborating with [Dr. Yujing Hu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IR5WY-wAAAAJ&hl), [Prof. Wotao Yin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kpQGGFUAAAAJ&hl), and [Cheng Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=5QdPzoAAAAAJ). He is currently a research intern with ByteDance's Seed-Robotic team.

His research interests encompass reinforcement learning, large language models, and large-scale AI applications, with a particular focus on power grid scheduling. He has published several first-author papers at top international AI conferences including ICML, AAAI, and IJCAI, as well as in leading journals such as IEEE Transactions on Power Systems. His work has received recognition in the academic community, as reflected in <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=NhsHZZwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>

Beyond research, he is passionate about fitness and enjoys running and strength training. You can follow his training journey on his [Strava profile](https://www.strava.com/athletes/wan_kris). He is also enthusiastic about trail running and hiking.
